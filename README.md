# ising

Ising simulation of 2D spin lattice. 
Dynamics of the system are MonteCarlo based
A Metropolis algorithm for either Glauber dynamics
or Kawasaki dynamics can be chosen.

Boltzmann's constant is set to unity.
The energy of one spin (i) is: E_ij = -J sum<i,j> S_i S_j
whith J also set to unity.
